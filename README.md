# AuraHUD (Project Omnis)

Private, voice-first **life HUD** powered by Life Aura. Alte’ Budgeting remains the money lens inside the same app.

PR quality gates from the governance stack stay in place. Product plans: [`docs/aurahud/`](docs/aurahud/).

## Product

### AuraHUD (new)

- Today Stream HUD (Now / Next / Captured) with unified command bar
- Local-first intent routing (Cloud AI **off by default**)
- Correction Memory (✗ is never silently re-assumed)
- Trust controls + AI receipts + public Privacy page
- Spend-less nudge → Budget lens

### Alte’ Budgeting (lens)

- Multi-budget manager with role invite links (unlimited uses, Share on mobile)
- Category auto-assign by percentage of Ready to Assign
- Profile management (display name + password)
- Budget screen (categories, assigned / activity / available)
- Accounts + transaction register
- Insights charts + rule-based trend tips
- YNAB register / Reflect **CSV import**
- Offline PWA: service worker caches app shell; cold starts paint from cache (stale-while-revalidate) with a dark splash so dark mode doesn’t flash white
- Plaid bank sync (Link + transactions sync) + daily Vercel Cron
- Supabase Auth + budget-scoped RLS
- Passkey (WebAuthn) or email/password sign-in (either works)
- Installable PWA shell

## Quickstart — AuraHUD / Alte' (cloud only)

This app is meant to run on **Vercel**. Secrets live in **Doppler** and sync into Vercel — no local CLI, no `.env` files.

### 1. Supabase

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run **all** SQL files in [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/) in order in the SQL editor (including multi-budget, Plaid, and assign-percent migrations). Skipping these causes logged-in pages to 500.
3. Enable Email auth (password) under Authentication → Providers
4. Enable **Passkeys** under Authentication → Passkeys (beta). Set Relying Party display name to `Alte' Budgeting`, RP ID to your app domain (e.g. `your-app.vercel.app`), and origins to your production/preview HTTPS URLs (plus `http://localhost:3000` for local). Also allow `/auth/callback` redirects under Authentication → URL Configuration.

### 2. Doppler (source of truth for secrets)

1. Create Doppler project `alte-budgeting`
2. In configs `dev` / `preview` / `prd`, set the keys listed in [`web/doppler.secrets.example`](web/doppler.secrets.example):
   - Required: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Invites: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
   - Cron / webhooks: `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (`sb_secret_…` from Supabase → API Keys; preferred over legacy `service_role`), `CRON_SECRET`, `BANK_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   - Plaid: `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV` (`sandbox` | `development` | `production`)
3. Doppler dashboard → **Integrations** → **Vercel**
4. Sync: `dev` → Development, `preview` → Preview, `prd` → Production

### 3. Vercel

1. Import this GitHub repo
2. Set **Root Directory** to `web`
3. Deploy — env vars arrive from the Doppler sync (do not paste secrets into Vercel by hand)
4. Cron: [`web/vercel.json`](web/vercel.json) hits `/api/cron/plaid-sync` daily at `15 12 * * *` UTC (6:15 AM Mountain) with `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET`. The route bypasses auth middleware, retries once per item, and logs loudly. Opening the app also catch-up syncs when the last sync is older than 16 hours.

Preview / production URLs come from Vercel after deploy.

### Plaid notes

- Keys: [Plaid Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com) → Team Settings → Keys
- Start with `PLAID_ENV=sandbox` (Link test user `user_good` / `pass_good`)
- Settings → **Connect bank** opens Plaid Link; categories left blank for you to assign
- Pending bank authorizations are imported as uncleared; Sync now does a full refresh
- Sync now remaps accounts and requests an on-demand Plaid bank refresh when available — disconnecting is not required to recover missing transactions
- Run migration `supabase/migrations/20260724150000_plaid_bank_sync.sql`
- Disconnect / Sync now are available per connected item on Settings

### YNAB CSV import

1. In YNAB web: budget name → **Export Budget**
2. Upload the **Register** CSV on **Import** in Alte' Budgeting
3. Expected headers: `Account, Date, Payee, Category Group/Category, Memo, Outflow, Inflow`

## Governance (unchanged)

```bash
cd governance && pip install -e ".[dev]" && ai-guardrail run --root ..
```

Require status checks on `main`: **Governance Steps 1–5**, **Enterprise Layers B–E**, and **CodeQL (Layer C)**.
